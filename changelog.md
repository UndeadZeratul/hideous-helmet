> Hopefully this fixes most of the major problems
* Fixed HUD not being hidden when using the automap.
* You can now customize what gets hidden when the helmet isn't equipped. *(By default, only the player status is hidden.)*
* Removed whitelist overwriting.
* Helmet now has a bit of defense. Don't count on it though, only applies to certain damage types.
* Helmet will now only lose durability to certain types of damage. *(might need some tweaking)*
