> TIL that bullets calculate damage on their own

* Hopefully fixed helmet spawning with 144 durability.
* Reworked defense, helmet now provides more defense to a headshot than a body/leg shot. *(might need some more work)*
* Helmet is now more durable due to the new defense rework...
* ...which also fixed helmet getting more durable depending on what armour type you were wearing.

> Hopefully this fixes most of the major problems

* Fixed HUD not being hidden when using the automap.
* Helmet can only be stripped through `hh_strip`, or by attempting to equip another helmet while wearing one.
* You can now customize what gets hidden when the helmet isn't equipped. *(By default, only the player status is hidden.)*
* Removed whitelist overwriting from the options menu.
* Helmet now has a bit of defense. Only applies to certain damage types.
* Helmet will now only lose durability to certain types of damage. *(might need some tweaking)*
* Should spawn a bit more frequently now.
