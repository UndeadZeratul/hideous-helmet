## What?
Hideous Helmet adds a new "armour" piece called `HUD Helmet`.

Some of the HUD is hidden without the helmet.\
*Note: You may toggle which part of the HUD gets hidden when not wearing the helmet.*

### Info about the helmet
* Shows all of the HUD when you wear it, with some extra stuff. *(extra stuff is toggleable)*
* Provides some defense, mostly for the head.
* Can be worn without removing armour first.
* *Should be noted that you can use medikit with the helmet on.*
* Can be removed with `hh_strip`.
* Will take damage and break like any armour.
* Shows a *"bleed indicator"*, with a *"wound counter"*. *(both are toggleable)*

### Armour Nerf
Due to the introduction of helmets, both the Garrison and Battle armour's head protection has been reduced.\
It should be noted that this is toggle-able.

### Loadout codes:
* `hdh` hud helmet (spare)
* `hhw` hud helmet

### Spawn info:
Has a chance to spawn at any armour.\
Marines or jackboots with helmets should also drop them on death.\
*(You can tweak the spawn rate)*

Note:\
Enemies don't actually wear the helmets, they just drop them. *(though, i could change that)*

## Releases?
You should only use the release versions if you're using a [release version of Hideous Destructor](https://codeberg.org/mc776/hideousdestructor/releases).\
Otherwise, just [clone the latest master](https://github.com/dastrukar/hideous-helmet/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) repo and pray that it works.

## Is this compatible with other addons?
It should work fine with other addons. *(if none of the overwriting stuff breaks anything)*\
Though, it's up to you to try and see.

## Patches, because not everything works
All patches made by me are located in the `hh_patches` folder. Just load them and it should work with the mod :].
(and if they don't, just let me know and i'll consider fixing them)

## Why a helmet?
Well, I always wondered what if you could wear a helmet item in Hideous Destructor, then I thought about combining the HUD and helmet together.\
Then, a question came up.

> What if your helmet breaks from excessive damage, and your HUD is gone?

And here we are.
