# Hideous Helmet
> An addon for [Hideous Destructor](https://codeberg.org/mc776/hideousdestructor). Adds a helmet that shows the HUD.

## What?
Hideous Helmet adds a new armour piece called `HUD Helmet`.

What does it do?
* Shows the HUD when you wear it. Clue's in the name.
* Does not provide defense.
* *Note: Most of the HUD does not show up without the helmet.*

Loadout codes:
* hud helmet (spare) `hdh`
* hud helmet `hhw`

Spawns at any armour and marine corpse. *(at least it should)*

## Why??
Well, I always wondered what if you could wear helmets in Hideous Destructor, then I thought about the HUD and the helmet.

Then, a question came up.

> What if your helmet breaks from excessive damage, and your HUD is gone?

And here we are.


## Is this compatible with other addons?
Probably not.

Though, it's up to you to try and see.


## Are there any releases?
Nope.

Just download the latest `master` repo and pray that it works.
