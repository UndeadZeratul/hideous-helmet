# Hideous Helmet
> An addon for [Hideous Destructor](https://codeberg.org/mc776/hideousdestructor) [*(Forum link)*](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=12973). Adds a helmet that shows the HUD.
>
> Alternatively known as "HUD Helmet"

## What?
Hideous Helmet adds a new "armour" piece called `HUD Helmet`.

What does it do?
* Shows the all of the HUD when you wear it.
* Provides a bit of defense.
* *Note: You may toggle which part of the HUD gets hidden when not wearing the helmet.*

Loadout codes:
* `hdh` hud helmet (spare)
* `hhw` hud helmet

Spawns at any armour and marine corpse. *(at least it should)*

## Why?
Well, I always wondered what if you could wear helmets in Hideous Destructor, then I thought about the HUD and the helmet.

Then, a question came up.

> What if your helmet breaks from excessive damage, and your HUD is gone?

And here we are.

## Is this compatible with other addons?
It should work fine with other addons. *(if none of the overwriting stuff breaks anything)*

Though, it's up to you to try and see.


## Are there any releases?
Just download the latest [`master`](https://github.com/dastrukar/hideous-helmet/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) repo and pray that it works.
