## What?
Hideous Helmet adds a new "armour" piece called `HUD Helmet`.

Some of the HUD is hidden without the helmet.\
*Note: You may toggle which part of the HUD gets hidden when not wearing the helmet.*

### Info about the helmet
* Shows all of the HUD when you wear it, with some extra stuff. *(extra stuff is toggleable)*
* Provides a bit of defense, mostly for the head.
* Can be worn without removing armour first.
* *Should be noted that you can use medikit with the helmet on.*
* Can be removed with `hh_strip`.
* Will take damage and break like any armour.

### The extra stuff
* Shows a *"bleed indicator"*, with a *"wound counter"*. *(both are toggleable)*

### Loadout codes:
* `hdh` hud helmet (spare)
* `hhw` hud helmet

### Spawn info:
Spawns at any armour and marine corpse. *(at least it should)*\
Jackboots with helmets should also drop them on death.\
*(You can tweak the spawn rate)*

## Are there any releases?
Just download the latest [`master`](https://github.com/dastrukar/hideous-helmet/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) repo and pray that it works.

## Is this compatible with other addons?
It should work fine with other addons. *(if none of the overwriting stuff breaks anything)*\
Though, it's up to you to try and see.

## Why a helmet?
Well, I always wondered what if you could wear a helmet item in Hideous Destructor, then I thought about combining the HUD and helmet together.\
Then, a question came up.

> What if your helmet breaks from excessive damage, and your HUD is gone?

And here we are.
